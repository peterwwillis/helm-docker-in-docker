Use this if you want a Docker daemon in a Kubernetes cluster - for example, if you have developers who want to use familiar Docker tooling to do development, without needing a Docker install on their client machines. USAGE Install the helm chart Add the helm repo, update it, and install from it, generating a new random name for the new install. You can repleace --generate-name with a shorter static name (like \"dind\") if this is the only install in your namespace. $ helm repo add dind https://peterwwillis.github.io/helm-docker-in-docker/ \"dind\" has been added to your repositories $ helm search repo dind NAME CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION dind/docker-in-docker 0.0.2 24.0.2-dind A Helm chart to deploy Docker-in-Docker (dind) $ helm repo update Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the \"dind\" chart repository Update Complete. \u2388Happy Helming!\u2388 $ helm install dind/docker-in-docker --generate-name NAME: docker-in-docker-1687405617 LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Jun 21 23:47:01 2023 NAMESPACE: my-namespace STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: Docker-in-Docker is deployed!
