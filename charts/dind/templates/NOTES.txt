Docker-in-Docker is deployed!

To connect to the Docker daemon:
{{- if .Values.secureDocker }}
  1. Set the following environment variables for your Docker client:
       DOCKER_HOST=tcp://{{ include "dind.fullname" . }}:{{ include "dind.servicePort" . }}
       DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs
       DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/certs/client
       DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
  2. Download the kubernetes secret '{{ include "dind.fullname" . }}-cert-client' and create the
     following files for the Docker client:
       'ca.crt' -> /certs/client/ca.pem
       'tls.crt' -> /certs/client/cert.pem
       'tls.key' -> /certs/client/key.pem
  3. Use your Docker client as normal. It should automatically authenticate via TLS.
